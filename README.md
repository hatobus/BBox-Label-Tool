Environment
----------
- python 2.7
- python PIL (Pillow)

Run
-------
$ python main.py

Usage
-----
0. The current tool requires that **the images to be labeled reside in /Images/001, /Images/002, etc. You will need to modify the code if you want to label images elsewhere**.
1. Input a folder number (e.g, 1, 2, 5...), and click `Load`. The images in the folder, along with a few example results will be loaded.
2. To create a new bounding box, left-click to select the first vertex. Moving the mouse to draw a rectangle, and left-click again to select the second vertex.
  - To cancel the bounding box while drawing, just press `<Esc>`.
  - To delete a existing bounding box, select it from the listbox, and click `Delete`.
  - To delete all existing bounding boxes in the image, simply click `ClearAll`.
3. After finishing one image, click `Next` to advance. Likewise, click `Prev` to reverse. Or, input an image id and click `Go` to navigate to the speficied image.
  - Be sure to click `Next` after finishing a image, or the result won't be saved. 

Usage resize_convert
-------
BBox tool's picture ext is "&#42.JPEG". But some jpeg file's ext is "&#42.jpg" "&#42.jpeg" "&#42.jpe". And, deeplearning framework has image sizes limit.

0. To check framework's image sizes limit.
1. Resize class's first argument is width, second argument is height.
2. Default resize size is 256 * 256. If you need it, you need to change
3. When you run this python file need 2 argument. 1st argument is path to image file. 2nd argument is path to output folder.
